Title: FACE DETECTION USING MTCNN WITH DENSENET FOR ENHANCED SECURITY

Duration: 1 year

Description: This thesis titled “Face Detection using MTCNN with DenseNet for Enhanced
Security” presents an innovative approach to enhance the robustness and security of
face detection systems.The research tackles a major security system vulnerability:
the ability of current face detection systems to identify changes in circumstances and
spoofing attacks. The objective is to create a system that is resistant to security
threats and can detect faces reliably under a range of circumstances and scales. The
study suggests integrating Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) with Multi-Task
Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN) in order to do this. DenseNet is a
deep learning model that takes advantage of its densely linked layers to improve on
MTCNN, a widely used face detection technique.The proposed system is expected to
improve the performance of face detection, making it more robust and secure. The
effectiveness of the combined model is validated through rigorous experimentation and
evaluation on standard datasets. The results demonstrate the potential of DenseNet
in improving the robustness and security of face detection systems, paving the way
for more secure applications in areas such as surveillance, biometric authentication,
and social media.
